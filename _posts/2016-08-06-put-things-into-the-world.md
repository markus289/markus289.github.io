[Ben Horowitz](http://www.bhorowitz.com/about) gave a [speech](https://a16z.com/2015/05/28/some-career-advice-for-all-you-recent-graduates/)
to the Columbia University’s class of 2015.
Watch the video or read the transcript if you have the time.
In my opinion, he said one particular encouraging sentence.

> When you go through life, what you’ll find is what you take out of the world
> over time — be it money, cars, stuff, accolades — is much less important than
> what you’ve put into the world.
