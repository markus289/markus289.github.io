### Tense and Voice

|                   | Introduction                                      | Methods                                                                       | Results                                               | Discussion            |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| predominant Tense | Present (because generalization) (not prior work) | Past (research is done)                                                       | Present (presenting at the same time you are writing) | Past, Present, Future |
| predominant Voice | Active                                            | Passive ("the substance was heated") (we don't matter. not "our HiWi did...") | Active (Figure 4 shows) (not: as shown in Figure 4)   | Active                |

### Constructing sentences

- *Use one idea per sentence.*
- *Shorten sentences by splitting them into two.*
- *Write your sentences as direct or straightforward statements.*
  Such sentences (like this one) have the subject at the start.
  The verb and the object follow straightaway.
  There is no long, explanatory phrase at the beginning of a direct sentence.
  There is no marginal information somewhere in the middle.
- *Write positive sentences.*
  Negative sentences contain words such as "no", "not", "none", "nor", "nothing" and "never".
  Positive sentences lack these words.
  Generally, positive sentences are easier to understand and more simple to construct than negative ones.
- *Write active sentences.*
  Active sentences are more direct, shorter and clearer.
  However, it is your decision whether you use more active sentences than passive ones.
  If you think you can transmit your thoughts better using passive sentences, then go ahead.
- *Omit needless words.*

### Verbs

One distinctive feature of academic writing is choosing the more formal
alternative when selecting a verb, noun, or other part of speech.

English often has two (or more) choices to express an action or occurrence.
The choice is often between a phrasal verb (verb + particle) or prepositional verb (verb + preposition) and a single verb, the latter with Latinate origins.
Often in lectures and other instances of everyday spoken English, the verb + preposition is used; however, for written academic style there is a tencency for academic writers to use a single verb wherever possible.
This is one of the most dramatic stylistic shifts form informal to formal style.
Here is an example.

> According to some biologists, *coming up with* clear proof of the
> decreasing number of frogs has been difficult. (less formal style)
>
> According to some biologists, *offering* clear proof of the
> decreasing numbers of frogs has been difficult. (academic style)

### Some Heading

The following are some nonvocabulary-related recommendations for
maintaining a formal academic writing style.

 1. Generally avoid constructions (but keep in mind that in some fields
    it may be OK to use them).

    | less formal style                                           | formal style                                                   |
    |-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Export figures won't improve until the economy is stronger. | Export figures will not improve until the economy is stronger. |

 2. Use the more appropriate formal negative forms.

    | less formal style                                            | formal style                                             |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
    | *not ... any*                                                | *no*                                                     |
    | The analysis didn't yield any new results.                   | The analysis yielded no new results.                     |
    | *not ... much*                                               | *little*                                                 |
    | The government didn't allocate much funding for the program. | The government allocated little funding for the program. |
    | *not ... many*                                               | *few*                                                    |
    | This problem doesn't have many viable solutions.             |                                                          |

 3. Limit the use of "run-on" expressions, such as *and so forth* and *etc.*

    | less formal style                                          | formal style                                                                          |
    |------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | The semiconductors can be used in robots, CD players, etc. | These semiconductors can be used in robots, CD players, and other electronic devices. |

 4. Avoid addressing the reader as *you* (except, of cause, if you are writing a textbook or other instruction materials.)

    | less formal style                                                                                | formal style                                                                                      |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | You can see the results in Table 1.                                                              | The results can be seen in Table 1.                                                               |
    | You can classify individuals as Morning Types (MTs), Evening Types (ETs), or Neither Type (NTs). | Individuals can be classified as Morning Types (MTs), Evening Types (ETs), or Neither Type (NTs). |

 5. Be careful about using direct questions.
    In some fields they are common, while in others they are not.

    | less formal style                | formal style                                          |
    |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
    | What can be done to lower costs? | It is necessary to consider how costs may be lowered. |
    |                                  | *or*                                                  |
    |                                  | We now need to consider how costs may be lowered.     |

 6. Place adverbs within the verb.

    In academic writing adverbs are often placed midposition rather than in the initial or final positions.
    In informal English adverbs often occur at the beginning or end of sentences.

    | less formal style                                                                                | formal style                                                                                    |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Actually, very little is known about the general nature and prevalence of scientific dishonesty. | Very little is actually known about the general nature and prevalence of scientific dishonesty. |
    | The model was developed by Krugman (1979) originally.                                            | The model was originally developed by Krugman (1979).                                           |

 7. Consider whether you should split infinitives.

    The presciptive view of grammar condemns the use of split infinitives (placing an adverbial modifier between *to* and the infinitive as in *to sharply rise*).
    Although we would agree that split infinitives are not so common in academic writing, they are sometimes used, particularly in order to avoid awkwardness or ambiguity.

    Here are some examples of split infinitives.

    > We need *to adequately meet* the needs of those enrolled in the program.
    >
    > Neural networks have the ability *to correctly classify* new patterns.
    >
    > The size of the container could be modified *to downwardly adjust* the portion size and amount of consumption.

 8. Aim for an efficient use of words.

    Use as many words as you need to express your points; try to use no more than you really need.

    | less formal style                                                                                                                                   | formal style                                                                  |
    |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | It may be difficult to make a decision about the method that we should use.                                                                         | Choosing the proper method may be difficult.                                  |
    | There are some inorganic materials that can be used by bioengineers in the process of tissue engineering that have been shown to be very promising. | Some inorganic materials used in tissue engineering have shown great promise. |

### Words used instead of more everyday words in an academic context

| everyday verb           | academic verb   |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| add (at the end)        | append          |
| think up                | conceive        |
| go against              | contradict      |
| meet                    | convene         |
| show                    | demonstrate     |
| be a sign of, stand for | denote          |
| make useless, wipe out  | negate          |
| see                     | perceive        |
| lie, live               | reside          |
| cause                   | trigger         |
| use                     | utilise         |
| the opposite            | the converse    |
| very important          | crucial         |
| similarly               | likewise        |
| despite this            | notwithstanding |
| rather                  | somewhat        |
| in this way             | thereby         |
| by which (method)       | whereby         |

### A Usage Guide for Scientists and Engineers

"Usage" refers to the selection of the proper word.
Some selections are clear-cut.
For instance, no matter what reference book you consult, "its" is defined as "of it" and "it's" is defined as "it is".
Other choices are not so clear.
For example, some liberal sources, such as *Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary*, treat "farther" and "further" as synonyms, while conservative sources, such as *Elements of Style", do not.
Because scientific writing is more traditional than other kinds of writing, you should probably lean to the conservative side in your usage.
This appendix presents a guide to common usage questions.
At the end is a list of traditional usage references.

*-ability words:* A word ending in "ability" is a signal that you can tighten the sentence by having the word "can" precede the verb buried in the "ability" word.
Although examples such as "capability" are not offensive, pretentious constructions such as "operationability" and "manufacturability" are.
Rewrite the sentence using "can operate" and "can manufacture".

*abstract nouns:* nouns that offer none of the five senses to the audience.
Common abstract nouns in scientific writing are "environment", "factor", and "nature".
If you have to use an abstract noun, ground it with an example.

*active voice/passive voice:* In general, the active voice (having to subject perform the action) is a more natural way to communicate because it is crisper and more efficient than the passive voice.
However, for those occasions in which the subject of your writing is acted upon, the passive voice is more natural.

*affect/effect:* "Affect" is a verb and means to influence (note that in psychology, "affect" has a special meaning as a noun).
"Effect" is usually a noun and means a result.
Occasionally people use "effect" as a verb meaning to bring about: "He effected the change of orders."

*alright:* not accepted usage. Use "all right".

*always:* a frightening word because it invites readers to think of exceptions.
If an exception exists, your readers will find it, and your authority will be undercut.
You should go in fear of absolutes.

*approximately:* appropriate when used to modify a measurement's accuracy to within a fraction, but inappropriate when applied to a situation such as "approximately twelve people".
Does the writer mean 11.75 or 12.25 people?
In such cases, use the simple word "about".

*center around:* The phrase "center around" makes no physical sense.
You should either use the phrase "center on" or "revolve around".

*clichés:* descriptive phrases that have become trite.
Common examples include "come up to speed" and "sticks out like a sore thumb".
If a descriptive phrase sounds cute, avoid it.

*component:* often can be replaced by the simple word "part".

*comprise/compose:* "Comprise" literally means to include.
Most conservative sources such as *Elements of Style* hold to that literal definition.
For that reason, conservative sources insist on the whole comprising the parts, not the reverse.
Likewise, conservative sources shun the phrase "is comprised of".

*conjunctions:* Conjunctions, such as "and" and "but", are powerful words that connect words, phrases, and clauses.
Is it proper to begin sentences with conjunctions?
Although some formal scientific journals frown on this usage, many respected publications, including *The New York Times*, allow it.
With time, this usage will likely become accepted everywhere.

*continuous/continual:* "Continual" means repeatedly: "For two weeks, the sperm whales continually dived to great depths in search of food."
The word "continuous" means without interruption: "The spectrum of light is continuous."

*criterion/criteria:* "Criterion" is the singular form, and "criteria" is the plural form.
Note that this word comes from Greek, which explains the unusual plural form.

*data:* a plural form of "datum", a Latin word.
Because "datum" is no longer used in English, many sources consider "data" acceptable as either singular or plural.
Many conservatives refuse to budge on this word.
If you need a singular form and do not want to ruffle feathers, spend a few extra words and write "a data point".

*facilitate:* a bureaucrat's word.
Opt for simpler wording "cause" or "bring about".

*farther/further:* Conservative sources distinguish between "farther" and "further", advocating the "farther" be used to indicate distance, and "further" be used for all other variables: time, intensity, depth of meaning.
However, many conservative sources, including Bernstein (1965), admit that "further" will eventually become accepted for all uses.

*fewer/less:* In general, use "fewer" for items that can be counted and "less" for items that cannot.
For that reason, write "fewer cells", "fewer errors", and "fewer fish in the stream".
Likewise, write "less water", "less air", and "less foliage".
Exceptions include sums of money and time: "less than five years ago" and "less than 1 million dollars".

*first person:* the use of "I" or "we".
Occasional use of the first person can help reduce the unnatural use of passive voice.
As long as the emphasis remains on the subject of the writing, there is nothing inherently wrong with using the first person.
You should understand, though, that some editors and managers (to their deaths) will forbid its use in scientific writing.

*however:* an adverb that has the same meaning, but not the same sentence function, as the coordinating conjunction "but".
A coordinating conjunction can join two independent clauses; an adverb cannot.
Is it proper to begin a sentence with "however"?
Yes.
As a transition word at the beginning of a sentence, "however" is accepted by all but the most conservative of readers.

*implement:* a pet verb of bureaucrats.
Consider substituting "put into effect" or "carry out".
These verb phrases are old and simple.
They're the verb phrases that Winston Churchill would have used.
